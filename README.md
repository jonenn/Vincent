# Vincent Blog

**Disclaimer: This is more of an anecdotic project.**

It was my first website from scratch ever. I'll use kind of an informal English, just to make it an easy journey.

I have always been impressed (see what I did there?) by this post-impressionist artist named Vincent van Gogh, his "Starry Night" was the most moving picture for me ever; along with "The Garden of Earthly Delights", but that's another story.

So, I was there with a bunch of Web Developing things to learn and I wanted it to be significative, I was browsing through his pieces of art, and I wanted to enter to this Bootcamp (which I won't name here) and presented it as a requirement to get there.

It is basically a summary of his bio and curiosities I made based on Wikipedia. I also wanted it to be a showcase for his Opus, but then I found I was limited by the early learning path and the bootcamp's requirements, next thing I wanted to do was a better and mostly CSS-based static website and a gallery of course. This is then just an informative website. This is exactly the website I would have wanted to make as a kid. Non-WordPress nor Joomla nor related.

I remember learning HTML, although I had used it before as a kid, but I didn't even really know what I was doing, it also happened with CSS. I just knew that I wanted to have my own site in cyberspace, I've always liked to write, draw and messing things up so I could learn my way of fixing them.

### Challenges Met

As I learned HTML I understood the importance of tags, syntax and the things they meant for bots of any search engine and some things about SEO, but I also realized the more I inspected websites the more I could see those non-so-good practices some devs had. So, my first steps were based on content in relation with a good HTML. I also remember having some trouble with "center" tag, because when I was a kid, it was meant to be used and CSS probably wasn't still kind of a big thing, now it was deprecated.

I understood the structure of an HTML and the structure of a body, the "header", "navbar", "main" and "footer" tags. I used the "hard way" of coding with VI and VIM as my main IDE, so I was also learning bash through a virtual machine, so I finally use this knowledge to manage my site versions with Git and GitHub. Through this website I had this thing I didn't want to use div, so instead I learned I should use section, which was more meaningful and related to what I meant. Then I had to connect CSS and HTML, finally it could look better, for me it was the best part, since I've always loved design, but I didn't want it to be the focus and as in programming, there were many things I wanted to do, but as it was a process, I knew I still couldn't. The form in which you can write your e-mail was the one that took me some more time, I wanted it to look modern and nothing related to the squared one given from scratch. CSS was pretty awesome I knew everyone used classes but didn't know what the big deal was with using IDs. CSS was everything I always wanted to know when using free-hosted or CMS platforms or even non-code websites that supported these two technologies.

When I visited this site on my phone, I know there was something wrong, I had to start to learn about responsiveness, box model and flex. I had to create this page named "Tweets" as a requirement and also had some troubles with the external code used to show those tweets.
